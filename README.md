ft_printf Project - A Custom Implementation of printf
ft_printf

Welcome to the ft_printf project. This is a simplified replica of the standard printf function in C programming. It's designed to handle basic elements of the printf function, offering a compact solution for limited printf functionality.

Key Features of ft_printf
Supported Data Types: ft_printf is capable of handling specific data type identifiers - integer (i), hexadecimal in lowercase (x), unsigned decimal integer (u), hexadecimal in uppercase (X), pointers (p), characters (c), and strings (s).

ReturnValue: ft_printf also returns the count of characters that have been printed, localized to the types it supports, much like the standard printf's functionality.

Getting Started
This section will walk you through the steps to get a copy of the ft_printf project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS)
C compiler (preferably gcc)
Fundamental understanding of C programming

Acknowledgements
A big thank you to all individuals who have offered suggestions, identified bugs, or contributed in any manner. Your invaluable inputs have undoubtedly shaped and improved the ft_printf project.
Note regarding the project name: The ft_printf is part of libft (Library 42). The name is a nod to the famous phrase from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams - where 42 is "the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything".
